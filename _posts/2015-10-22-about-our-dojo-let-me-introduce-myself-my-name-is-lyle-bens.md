About our Dojo Let me Introduce Myself... My name is Lyle Benson. I am the Sensei here at Kaizen/Tenchi Jin Dojo and I'd like to welcome you. I have been a martial artist for over 40 years with 27 of those years focused on teaching. I have lived and trained in Japan, been on the Discover Channel, founded the Samurai Museum, and run a top notch martial arts school. Enjoy you're visit! My students receive instruction tailored to their personal needs and requirements in an atmosphere that supports them in their growth as a person and as a martial artist. We don't believe in gimmick or fads, nor can we promise that traditional martial arts will be quick or easy. We do promise to do our best to make you a competent, confident and complete martial artist. Regardless of age or gender -- you will find our approach to martial arts training to be a positive life-changing experience that can improve your physical and mental health while teaching you a skill set for life and to protect yourself. Training in Ninjutsu Provides Great Opportunity. Learn powerful martial arts for self-defense. Become more physically fit. Train yourself to have a more positive outlook. Best of all you'll be having a great time with people just like you. Welcome to Kaizen Martial Arts.
